## User Stories

###### As grocery owner, I follow regulation strictly to provide fresh food to my customers, but there are still a lot of perishable food wasted everyday. Once food hits its sell-by date, they became unsaleables, I will be able to use the app: 
- Login as grocery store owner / register if first time using the app
- Post Food near or past its best-before date with prodcut photos, name, qty on daily basis
- Once I got zero value order from charity orgnization for the food they need, I will be able to contact with them to arrange food delivery.

###### As charity orgnization, I want to help my community and collect information from grocery store:
- Login as charity organization/ register if first time using the app
- check on map to see all stores posted food for donation around me
- when I click one store, I will have the detailed list of donation food
- I could select and add to my cart, then place order with no money traction though
- I will then be contacted by grocery owner for food delivery arrangement
